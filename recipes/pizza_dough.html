    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 envelope instant dry yeast</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.  </li>
                <li>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes</li>
            </ol>
