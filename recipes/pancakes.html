                <li>2 eggs, seperated</li>
                <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                <li>2 cups "Instant" Pancake Mix</li>
                <li>1 stick of butter, for greasing the pan</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh fruit if desired</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat an electric griddle or frying pan to 350 degrees F. Heat oven to 200 degrees F. </li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugars, butter, shortening, salt, vanilla extract, vinegar, and baking soda, beating until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Combine the buttermilk mixture with the egg yolk mixture in a large mixing bowl and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Pour the liquid ingredients on top of the pancake mix. Using a whisk, mix the batter just enough to bring it together. Don't try to work all the lumps out. </li>
                <li>Check to see that the griddle is hot by placing a few drops of water onto to the griddle. The griddle is ready if the water dances across the surface.</li>
                <li>Lightly butter the griddle. Wipe off thoroughly with a paper towel. (No butter should be visible.) </li>
                <li>Gently ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle and sprinkle on fruit if desired. When bubbles begin to set around the edges of the pancake and the griddle-side of the cake is golden, gently flip the pancakes. Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the pancake is set. </li>
                <li>Serve immediately or remove to a towel-lined baking sheet and cover with a towel. Hold in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
            </ol>
